## Task 1: ID Set of Patents That Define Current Body Armor Technology 

Using the USPTO's Advanced Search function at http://appft.uspto.gov/netahtml/PTO/search-adv.html and enter the following search string to find patents with "armor" in the title, granted from Jan 1 2010 until Jun 30 2017: ((APT/1 AND TTL/armor) AND APD/20100101->20170630) where APD is application date (not the patent grant date), TTL is title, and APT/1 means we are looking for utility patents only. This search string yielded the most applicable set of patents; using "body armor" in the title was too specific (did not yield a large enough patent set) and using a keyword search on the abstract yielded too board/diverse of a patent set.

This search yielded 181 patents. Patent number and title for each of these 181 patents is available in this file:

This set of 181 armor patents was refined by reading each patent title, and ensuring that the title was reflective of a patent related to body armor. After this human review, we are left with ### patents that best represent current body armor technology. This downselected set of base body armor patents is available in this file:
